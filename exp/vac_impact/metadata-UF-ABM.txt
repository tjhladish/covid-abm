  "The model is a data-driven, stochastic, discrete-time, ABM with an explicit representation of
  people and places. The model represents 20.6 million people residing in 11.2 million households
  and 3.8 thousand long-term care facilities and who work in 2.3 million workplaces and attend 7.6
  thousand schools. However, for this simulation study, we created a smaller sample of the entire
  synthetic population totalling 375,000 people. People in the model vary in behaviors that may
  result in transmission, and have attributes that may affect infection outcome including age and
  the presence or absence of comorbidities.

  We use this synthetic population as an input to a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, detection and
  reporting. The model centers on a daily cycle of transmission opportunities based on the
  co-localization of infectious and susceptible individuals in households, workplaces (both as employees
  and as customers), schools, long-term care facilities, and hospitals. This approach naturally produces
  crucial interaction patterns between locality-type and age, e.g., school-age individuals are assigned
  to a specific school during the day, where they face a risk of infection from other children from the
  same geographic locale."

  "Two types of NPIs are incorporated into our model: government interventions and
  personal-protective behaviors.

  Top-down, government interventions (such as school and non-essential business closures)
  are scheduled following the timeline of such interventions in the state of Florida. Because
  locations in the model have types and businesses are labeled as essential or non-essential,
  we can incorporate such interventions directly. In our model, these interventions occur early
  in 2020.

  Personal-protective behaviors (PPB) are modeled as a time-varying parameter that represents
  the level of protective behaviors in the population. Changing this parameter changes the
  level of social contact and the patronage of high-risk businesses (such as bars and restaurants)."

  "Infections become known with a certain probability dependent on the severity of symptoms. If an infection
  is detected and the individual dies, this is counted as a death. The chance of detection at each stage,
  exclusive of detection at previous stages, is 0.15 (mild), 0.6 (severe), 0.1 (critical) and 0.01 (death).
  The overall chance of detection cannot be determined from these parameters alone, without assuming an
  age-specific distribution of infections (which tends to change throughout a simulation). In practice,
  these rates of detection result in net detection rate of 60 to 70 % for severe cases, critical cases, or deaths.

  The observation model includes a time-dependent delay in reporting based on observed changes in reporting. In
  the model, the reporting delay for a case is sampled from a gamma distribution with a shape that reflects the
  actual reporting delays for Florida."

  "For all viral strains, the vaccine efficacy against infectiousness (VEI) is 40% after the
  first dose and 80% after the second dose."

  "The probability of an infection developing symptoms is age- and strain-dependent. This is also

  "There are two seperate types of seeding events.

  Before the simulation, the population is initially seeded with a probability of exposure of 4.0e-4.

  Secondly, during each simulated day, introductions occur with probability 1.0e-4 and
  will account for the the prevalence of different strains in the population."
