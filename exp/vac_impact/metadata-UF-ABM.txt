  "Two types of NPIs are incorporated into our model: government interventions and
  personal-protective behaviors.

  Top-down, government interventions (such as school and non-essential business closures)
  are scheduled following the timeline of such interventions in the state of Florida. Because
  locations in the model have types and businesses are labeled as essential or non-essential,
  we can incorporate such interventions directly. In our model, these interventions occur early
  in 2020.

  Personal-protective behaviors (PPB) are modeled as a time-varying parameter that represents
  the level of protective behaviors in the population. Changing this parameter changes the
  level of social contact and the patronage of high-risk businesses (such as bars and restaurants)."

  "For all viral strains, the vaccine efficacy against infectiousness (VEI) is 40% after the
  first dose and 80% after the second dose."

  "The probability of an infection developing symptoms is age- and strain-dependent. This is also
  by prior immunity (whether infection- or vaccine-derived)."

  "There are two seperate types of seeding events.

  Before the simulation, the population is initially seeded with a number of introductions
  where the probability of an individual being part of the initial seeding is 4.0e-4.

  Secondly, during each simulated day, introductions occur with probability 1.0e-4 and
  will account for the the prevalence of different strains in the population."
